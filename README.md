## Abstract
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods are often built on pixel-level localization maps obtained from a classifier. However, training on class labels only, classifiers suffer from the spurious correlation between foreground and background cues (e.g. train and rail), fundamentally bounding the performance of WSSS. There have been previous endeavors to address this issue with additional supervision. We propose a novel source of information to distinguish foreground from the background: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, or images devoid of foreground object classes. 
In particular, we utilize the hard OoDs that the classifier is likely to make false-positive predictions.
These samples typically carry key visual features on the background (e.g. rail) that the classifiers often confuse as foreground (e.g. train), so these cues let classifiers correctly suppress spurious background cues. Acquiring such hard OoDs does not require an extensive amount of annotation efforts; it only incurs a few additional image-level labeling costs on top of the original efforts to collect class labels.We propose a method, W-OoD, for utilizing the hard OoDs. 
W-OoD achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012.


## Installation

- We refer to the offical implementation of [IRN](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/irn).


## Usage

#### Step 1. Prepare Dataset

- Download PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark: [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2cYvmJ4u52FvZ722eIti1jf5hfGr6Rz/view?usp=sharing).
- Unzip and move it to "Data/"
- Download OoD images: [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zrwqiy-dt9aymtEzCt9qqWROMDj3EUUX)
- Unzip and move it to "WOoD_dataset/openimages"
- Download a list of OoD images [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjK55YL1jGHgA0LVA3djHu6vtFyho8kP/view?usp=share_link) and move 'ood_list.txt' to "WOoD_dataset/openimages"


#### Step 2. Prepare pre-trained in-distribution classifier

- Pre-trained model used in this paper: [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eaa7BV6PAfRPEZYBz5WtllUJxpnO-a-m/view?usp=sharing).
- Move it to "sess/"


#### Step 3. Obtain the pseudo ground-truth masks for PASCAL VOC train_aug images and evaluate them
```
bash bash_run_sample.sh
```

#### Step 4. Train a semantic segmentation network
- To train DeepLab-v2, we refer to [deeplab-pytorch](https://github.com/kazuto1011/deeplab-pytorch). However, this repo contains only COCO pre-trained model. We use ImageNet pre-trained model, provided by [AdvCAM](https://github.com/jbeomlee93/AdvCAM), for a fair comparison with the other methods.
